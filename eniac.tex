* insofar as one can do so without rebuilding the hardware.


\section{Second Challenge -- Improve upon the Original Model}
Since computation available is many orders of magnitude greater than the ENIAC's capability, there must be some allowance for how much computing capacity. So, in addition to quality of result, one must submit the compute requirement of the comparable (language, compilation options, etc.) of their
