Initial conditions:
* ftp://ftpprd.ncep.noaa.gov/pub/data/nccf/com/gfs/prod/gdas.YYYYMMDD/HH/
** gdas.tHHz.pgrb2.0p25.f000
** gdas.tHHz.sfluxgrbf000.grib2

Basic challenge is for 500 mb heights (500 hPa), initialized at 00 UTC from the NWS GDAS analysis, but with no updates on the boundaries. The ENIAC model used only an initial state. 

Challenge2 permits updates along the boundary, which will come from
* ftp://ftpprd.ncep.noaa.gov/pub/data/nccf/com/gfs/prod/gfs.YYYYMMDD/HH/
** gfs.tHHz.pgrb2.0p25.fHHH (hourly from 000 to 120 hours, 5 days)
** gfs.t00z.sfluxgrbfHHH.grib2

Reduced grib2 and netcdf files will be available at https://grumbinescience.org/ once there's an interest
